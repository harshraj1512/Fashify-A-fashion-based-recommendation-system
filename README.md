# Fashify
We know that robust and large-scale recommendation systems are already deployed on leading e-commerce websites like Amazon and Flipkart. But apart from these e-commerce giants, there are a massive number of businesses initiated during the pandemic times. Not all businesses can afford to employ machine learning engineers who can build huge and advanced recommendation systems for them. There’s a gap in the market for a product that can help newly-established businesses grow with low investment. Our product “Fashify” can bridge this gap. This was the motivation behind building this project to elevate the sales of the newly-established businesses which will, in turn, help in boosting the economy of the country if implemented on a wider scale. Since our product is feasible but effective at the same time, the prospective clients don’t need to invest much but still, they can get the desired results with the recommendations made by our product “Fashify”
